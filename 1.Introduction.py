############# NUMPY ################
'''
By using python we can perform normal mathematical operations like add, sub, mul, pow, sqrt, ceil, floor etc.
If we want to perform complex mathematical operations like statistics, linear algebra etc. we can go for numpy.
By using Numpy we can perform all those matematical operations Numpy provided several fuctions, classes and variables.

For learning AL & ML we have to go with numpy first.
If we want to perform numerical operations we have to with Numpy.
Numpy is acting as dependent library for matpotlib, plotly, pandas, scitik-learn, seaborn, OpenCV etc.

############ History of Numpy ###########
'''
Developed By Travis Oliphant.
Year 2005.
Numpy is written in C and Python Language, so numpy is very faster.

########## Features of Numpy #############
'''
Freeware and Opensource
NumPy is superfast
Required less memory
convenient for developer
Numpy is a best alternative of matlab. matlab is not open source.
